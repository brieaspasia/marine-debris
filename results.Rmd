# Site selection
10 sites at 5 locations were surveyed between 3-5 times each during summer 2019-2020.
```{r create-site-select}
#read in processed survey data
data <- read.csv(file="data/all_data.csv", 
                 header=T, sep=",", 
                 fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM") #removes special characters

data$Date <- dmy(data$Date) 
data$Notes <- as.character(data$Notes)

#keep only unsw surveys and sites with public piers and >2 survey rounds
site_select <- data %>%
  filter(Team=="UNSW" & 
           Location %in% c("DOUBL","WATSO","PARSL","NEUTR","CLIFT")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-Habitat2, -Fragment, -Whole)

#create a df for survey count per site
sampling_dates <- data %>%
  group_by(Location) %>%
  filter(Team=="UNSW") %>%
  count(Date)

#take away n
sampling_dates$n <- NULL

#create a column for survey count per site
sampling_dates <- sampling_dates %>%
  count(Location) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(NumberSurveys=n)

#join survey count to site select
site_select <- left_join(site_select, sampling_dates, by="Location")

site_select <- site_select %>%
  mutate(survey_event = paste(Date, Site,sep=" "))
```

# Debris types
CSIRO debris classification system was modified to assign a material type and whether they are fishing or non-fishing related for each debris item.  Dispersiveness was added as a trait using Tangaroa Blue classification system.
```{r load-item-code}
#load item names
item_code <- read.csv(file="data/CSIRO-code.csv", header=T, sep=",") 

#filter out material as some item types may have more than one material type 
#(ex. fishing items, furniture)
item_code <- item_code %>%
  dplyr::select(ID, item_name, Dispersiveness) 

site_select <- left_join(site_select, item_code, by="ID") 
```

# Site attributes
Each location included a 25m transect at a pier and an adjacent 25m soft sediment site in an area of boat traffic.  Distance from harbour mouth was calculated using ArcGIS Cost Distance analysis.
```{r load-site-attributes}
#load site coords and distance from harbour mouth
site_attr <- read.csv(file="data/site_attributes.csv", header=T, sep=",", fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM")

#add distance to harbour mouth to site_select data
site_attr <- site_attr %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, CostDis) %>% #select only distance to harbour mouth for join
  mutate(DistKm = CostDis/100) #distance to harbour mouth
  
#join distance to mouth to main dataset
site_select <- left_join(site_select, site_attr, by="Site") 
```
# Results
We accomplished 36 survey events at 10 sites between November 2019 and February 2020 and recorded 2,803 unique debris items.  

## Mean debris items per site
Here we see the proportion of debris items recovered under piers in blue, and the proportion recovered on soft sediment in orange.  In total across all sites, over 90% of the total debris recorded was collected under piers. The mean debris count at each site indicates that debris increases closer to the harbour mouth. 
```{r results-map, fig.cap="Fig 1: Mean debris count and proportion per habitat", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/results-map.png")
```
## Top twenty items
The most common item across all surveys was fishing line, at nearly 60% of the total debris recorded.  All other item types accounted for less than 10% of items total, with glass bottles, fishhooks/sinkers, and metal scraps (some fishing related) rounding out the top five.
```{r top-items, fig.cap="Table 1: Top twenty debris types across all surveys"}
#Find the top item types across all surveys
total_item <- site_select %>%
  group_by(Material, ID) %>%
  mutate(sum=sum(Total), #sum of total items by type
         sd=sd(Total)) %>% #sd of total items by type
        dplyr::select(ID, Material, sum, sd) %>% #remove irrelevant columns
        filter(sum>0) %>% #remove zero values
        arrange(desc(sum)) %>% #show high counts first
        distinct() %>% #remove duplicate entries
        ungroup()

total_item <- left_join(total_item, item_code, by="ID") #join item names

top_items <- total_item %>% top_n(20, sum) #show top 20 items total

top_items <- top_items %>%
           mutate(pct=sum/sum(sum)*100)

top20items <- top_items %>%
  dplyr::select(-Dispersiveness) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, format, digits=2) %>%
  kable("html", 
      col.names = c("ID", "Material", "Sum", "SD", "Name", "Percent"),
      caption = "Top 20 items across all surveys") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options="condensed", position="left")
top20items #print table
``` 
## Top items per habitat type
Glass bottles and fishing debris were common at both pier and soft sediment sites.  Piers had more metal scraps and fishing adjacent items, whereas soft sediment sites had more soft plastic bags and wrappers.

```{r top-items-per-habitat, fig.cap="Table 2: Top ten debris items per habitat"}
#top items per habitat
item_total_per_habitat <- site_select %>%
  group_by(Habitat, ID) %>% #separate the items by habitat type

         sd=sd(Total)) %>% #sd of total items by type
        dplyr::select(ID, Habitat, sum, sd)%>% #remove irrelevant columns
        filter(sum>0) %>% #remove null values
        arrange(desc(sum)) %>% #show high counts first
        distinct() %>% #remove duplicate entries
        ungroup()

#join item names
item_total_per_habitat <- left_join(item_total_per_habitat, item_code, by="ID") 

top_items_per_pier <- item_total_per_habitat %>% 
  filter(Habitat=="P") %>%
  top_n(10, sum) #show top 10 items over all piers

top_items_per_ss <- item_total_per_habitat %>% 
  filter(Habitat=="SS") %>%
  top_n(10, sum) #show top 10 items over all sediment sites

#combine the two tables
top_items_per_habitat <- rbind(top_items_per_pier, top_items_per_ss)

#create kable with both pier and sediment results
top10items_perHabitat <- top_items_per_habitat %>% 
  dplyr::select(-Dispersiveness) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, format, digits=2) %>% #set 2 decimal points
  kable("html", booktabs = TRUE, #nice format
      col.names = c("ID", "Habitat", "Sum", "SD", "Name"),
      caption = "Top 10 items per Habitat Type") %>% 
      pack_rows(index=c("Pier" = 10, "Sediment"=10)) %>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options="condensed", position="left") 

top10items_perHabitat #display table
```
## Mean of items by material type per site and habitat
Plastic is the most prevalent material type in almost every site, the notable exception being Clifton Gardens soft sediment site where glass was most common.
```{r material-setup, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# rename material categories 
site_total_mat <- site_select

#state variables to rename
var_change <- c("Ceramic", "Undetermined", "E-Waste", "Paper", "Construction", "Organic", "Unknown", "Timber", "Foam", "Brick or Cement", "Rubber", "Cloth", "") 

#change Material to character
site_total_mat$Material <- as.character(site_total_mat$Material) 

#set lesser used categories to 'Other'
site_total_mat$Material[site_total_mat$Material %in% var_change] = "Other" 
  
#find the top distribution of material type across all sites
total_mat <- site_total_mat %>%
  group_by(Site, Material) %>%  #group by material findings at each site
  summarise(sum=sum(Total), #total items per each material per site
            mean=mean(sum)/unique(NumberSurveys), #mean of items by material type per site
            sd=sd(Total)) %>% 
            ungroup()
```
```{r material-counts, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2: Mean items by material type per site and habitat"}
#create df for labeling habitats
site_habitat <- site_select %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, Habitat, Location) %>%
  distinct() 

#join for labeling
total_mat <- left_join(total_mat, site_habitat, by="Site") 

LocationLabs <- c(NEUTR = "Neutral Bay", CLIFT = "Clifton Gardens", PARSL = "Parsley Bay", WATSO = "Watsons Bay", DOUBL = "Double Bay")
HabitatLabs <- c(P = "Pier", SS = "Sediment")

p_total_mat <- total_mat %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=Habitat, y=mean, fill=Material)) +

``` 
## Mean of fishing vs non-fishing related items per site and habitat
Sites closer to the harbour mouth demonstrate a higher proportion of fishing related debris.  Fishing related debris was recorded more at pier sites rather than soft sediment sites.
```{r fishing-setup, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Isolate fishing vs non-fishing data
fishing <- site_select %>%
  group_by(Site, Fishing) %>% #group by fishing or non-fishing
  summarise(sum=sum(Total), #total fishing items
            mean=sum/unique(NumberSurveys),
            sd=sd(Total)) %>% #total per survey
  arrange(desc(mean))
```
```{r fishing-by-site, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3: Fishing related debris"}
site_habitat <- site_select %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, Habitat, Location) %>%
  distinct() #create df for labeling

fishing <- left_join(fishing, site_habitat, by="Site") #join for labeling

p_fishing <- fishing %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=Habitat, y=mean, fill=Fishing)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-sd, ymax=mean+sd, width=0.2), position=position_dodge(width=0.90)) +
  facet_wrap(~Location, scales = "free_y")

```
# Statistics

## GLMM negative binomial model
I aggregated debris totals by survey date and location and used a negative binomial GLMM model to fit the data.  Debris totals are predicted by habitat and distance from harbour mouth, both effected by whether debris was fishing related.  Location and Date are random effects.  All p-values are significant with this model fit.
```{r glm-2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#create df to use for models
mod <- site_select %>%
  group_by(Date, Location, Habitat, DistKm, NumberSurveys,
           Fishing) %>% #relevant variables
  summarise(Total=sum(Total)) 

#GLM negative binomial with two variables and zero inflation
m2  <- glmmTMB(Total ~ #Debris count
                 Fishing*Habitat + #predicted by Habitat (fishing or non-fishing)
                 Fishing*DistKm + #predicted by distance from mouth (fishing or non-fishing)
                 (1|Location/Date), #site random effect
               family=nbinom2(), #negative binomial to deal with count data and zeros
               data = mod) 
summary(m2)
```
## DHARMa simulation output
A visual inspection of the QQ plot could not identify deviations from normality.
```{r simulation-output-m2, fig.cap="Figure 4: DHARMa simulation output of GLMM model"}
simulationOutput <- simulateResiduals(fittedModel = m2, plot=T)

# Fourth corner analysis
Here we see that nothing is interacting significantly with distance to harbour mouth, however both fishing and unencumbered drift are interacting with habitat significantly.
